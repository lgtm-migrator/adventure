If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".
To suspend your adventure such that you can continue later, say
"SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE" or "SAVE").  To re-start your game at a later
time, start up a new adventure and after I say "You are standing...",
you must say "RESTORE".  You can also name your game by saying
"SUSPEND mine" (and "RESTORE mine") where "mine" is the name that
you wish your suspended name to be known by (1-12 characters).
To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".
To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get
partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting *does* happen,
it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
how much it will affect your score.  To save paper, you may specify
"BRIEF", which tells me never to repeat the full description of a
place unless you explicitly ask me to by saying "LOOK".  If you
are an experienced adventurer, you may wish to specify "FAST", which
is like "BRIEF" but more so;  in "FAST" mode I will *never* under
any circumstances give the full description of a place.  Finally, if
you are in "BRIEF" or "FAST" modes, you may return to the normal mode
of operation by saying "FULL".

> brief
Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
you come to it.  To get the full description, say "LOOK".

I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
UP, or DOWN.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
give you a list of the things you're carrying (you can say just
"INV" instead of "INVENTORY" if you wish).  The objects have side
effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
distances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually gets
you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
Good luck!

I'm afraid that I can't tell you anything more that would be useful;
you'll have to figure out what to do on your own.

There is a brilliant flash of light and a sudden fanfare of trumpets!
When your eyes recover from the flash, you find that:

It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
> light
Your lamp is now on.
You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall
says "Magic word XYZZY".

A three foot black rod with a rusty star on an end lies nearby.
> take rod
Ok.

You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. There is a dim light
at the east end of the passage.

There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.

You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high. The walls are frozen
rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
from east and west sides of the chamber.

A cheerful little bird is sitting here singing.

The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach it becomes
disturbed and you cannot catch it.

At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist. An east
passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.  Rough stone
steps lead down the pit.
> d
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
the west, filled with wisps of white mist that sway to and fro
almost as if alive.  Rough stone steps lead up to a passage at the
top of a dome above you.  A wide staircase runs downward into
the darkness;  a chill wind blows up from below.  There are small
passages to the north and south, and a small crack leads east.

This is a low room with a crude note on the wall. The note says,
"You won't get it up the steps".

There is a large sparkling nugget of gold here!

You are in a small chamber to the east of the Hall of Mists.  The
walls are composed of rough red sandstone.  There is a large, cubical
chunk of rock in the center of the room.

There is a sword here with its blade plunged deep into the block
of stone.  The sword is singing quietly to itself.

You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
